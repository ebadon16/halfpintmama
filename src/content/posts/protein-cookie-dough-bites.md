## Ingredients

- 1 scoop of vanilla protein powder

[Amazon link for clean protein powder we love!](https://amzn.to/4iUt87M)

- 1 Cup Almond Flour

- ¼ cup peanut butter

really any nut butter will work or sunflower butter for nut-free

- 2 tbsp of maple syrup 

- ½ tsp vanilla extract

- 3 tbsp natural sprinkles (dye-free for a healthier option)

- 1-2 TBSP of milk*

We used whole milk because we had it but almond milk would work as well

- The 1-2 TBSP of added milk gets it to the right consistency- depending on specific brands you use this may have to be slightly adjusted

## Instructions

Combine all dry ingredients (almond flour, protein powder and sprinkles) into a bowl and then stir together. This is an edible cookie no so with no raw eggs or all purpose flour it is safe to eat. This is great because my toddler is pretty fast to tryout what he's mixing together.

In a separate bowl combine the wet ingredients (nut butter, maple syrup, vanilla extract) and stir together. 

Add to dry ingredients and start to stir.

Add milk at this time and stir until dough forms. Start with 1 TBSP of milk and continue to stir. You can add an additional TBSP of milk, one at a time to get the right consistency. For us this took 2 TBSP of milk. I think almond milk would be great, we just always have whole milk at home so that is what we used.

Roll into balls and place on parchment paper lined baking sheet. I would say we did roughly about 1 TBSP size, but you can make these as small or big as you would like. Place in the refrigerator for at least 20-30 minutes.

### Baking with a Toddler

Baking with a toddler is equal parts joyful and messy, turning a simple recipe into a delightful adventure. Little hands eager to pour, stir, and sneak tastes make the kitchen come alive with laughter and curiosity. Measuring ingredients becomes a mini math lesson, it is practice with dexterity and a sensory activity like no other. While flour might end up on the floor as much as in the bowl, these spills and smudges create memories just as sweet as the treats themselves. I am always so amazed what little humans can do with practice and a little patience. Baking with a toddler may take a bit longer, but it’s filled with so many amazing moments.

We absolutely love this toddler tower. One of my favorite things is that we can wipe it down to clean it. It folds up pretty compact but we typically keep it at the counter. Porter loves helping so this is a necessity!
