### Step-by-Step Recipe

**Ingredients**

- 2 large eggs

- 1/3 cup of maple syrup 

- 1 tsp of vanilla extract 

- 1 cup of peanut butter

- 1 tbsp of baking powder

Step 1: Preheat and prep
Set your oven to 350°F (177°C). Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper or a [Silicone Sheet](https://amzn.to/42Y7GKa). I also love using our [Caraway Stainless Steel Baking Sheet](https://amzn.to/40mKz9u) because I don't have to put anything else down and it's already nonstick.

Step 2: Whip the eggs
Crack the eggs into the bowl of a stand [Mixer](https://amzn.to/4i2PgfO) (or use a hand mixer). Using the whisk attachment, beat on medium speed for about 1 minute. You want them to become light and frothy.

Step 3: Add natural sweetener
Add in the maple syrup and vanilla extract.

Turn the mixer to high speed and whip the mixture for about 2 more minutes. At this point you want it to thicken and have a pale yellow coloring. This helps the structure of the cookie and allows them to puff up without flour.

Step 4: Mix in peanut butter and baking powder
Add the peanut butter and baking powder. I like to gently fold them into the whipped mixture with a [Silicone Spatula](https://amzn.to/4h8Pylm). The batter should thick and glossy at this point. Be careful not to over-mix, or else you will take all the air out that you whipped into the eggs.

Step 5: Scoop and shape
Use a 1.5 tablespoon [Cookie Scoop](https://amzn.to/3CqHJYQ) or a spoon to portion the dough onto your baking sheet. These don’t spread a lot, but make sure to give them space to bake evenly. If doing smaller just reduce the baking time and the opposite for larger portioned cookies-just increase the baking time.

Step 6: Bake
Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, until the cookies are puffed and just starting to turn golden brown around the edges. 

Step 7: Cool
Let the cookies rest on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a cooling rack. They do firm up as they cool.

**Tips**

- You could do some fun add ins -chopped nuts (be careful of choking hazards depending on age of children eating cookies) or dark chocolate chips before baking.

- These freeze well—store extras in an airtight container in the freezer for up to 3 months.

- These do not keep very long at room temperature, 2-3 days in a airtight container- but honestly these go pretty fast in our house so we don't have to worry about this too much
