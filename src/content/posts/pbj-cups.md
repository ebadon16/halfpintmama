Combine the ingredients into a bowl and then stir together. One great thing about this mixture is there is no raw eggs so it is safe to eat. My toddler is pretty fast to tryout what he's mixing together.

I use a creamy natural peanut butter but really any nut butter would work. If you are looking for a nut-free option, sunflower butter should work just fine. I used honey since all my kiddos are over 1 year old now, but if you are giving these to anyone under 1- I would do an even switch of maple syrup. The ground flaxseed is optional but a great add in for some extra fiber. The milk can be dairy or non-dairy, we are using whole milk because we always have plenty of it.

Line a mini muffin tin with liners or lightly grease it. This is the [silicone mini muffin pan](https://amzn.to/4lgeSIk) we love. It is made of silicone and I use some coconut oil to lightly grease it. Then you can easily pop the treats out!

Scoop about 1 tablespoon of the oat mixture into each cup and press down. Make a area in the center for the jelly to go, pushing the oat mixture up the sides a little.

Add 1 teaspoon of fruit jelly/jam in the center. Optional switch-Instead of the fruit jam you could do a homemade chia seed jam for a no-sugar-added option. Top with another layer of the oat mixture, pressing gently to cover the jam. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour to firm up.

Now they are ready to enjoy! Store in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week.

 Perfect for little hands—soft, chewy, and packed with flavor!

### Baking with a Toddler

Baking with a toddler is equal parts joyful and messy, turning a simple recipe into a delightful adventure. Little hands eager to pour, stir, and sneak tastes make the kitchen come alive with laughter and curiosity. Measuring ingredients becomes a mini math lesson, it is practice with dexterity and a sensory activity like no other. While flour might end up on the floor as much as in the bowl, these spills and smudges create memories just as sweet as the treats themselves. I am always so amazed what little humans can do with practice and a little patience. Baking with a toddler may take a bit longer, but it’s filled with so many amazing moments.

We absolutely love this toddler tower. One of my favorite things is that we can wipe it down to clean it. It folds up pretty compact but we typically keep it at the counter. Porter loves helping so this is a necessity!
