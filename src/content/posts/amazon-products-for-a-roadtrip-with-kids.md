## Our Road Trip Essentials

### 1. Activity Bag

This is the bag we keep all of our car activities in. We put this away when not in use, that way these toys feel exciting and new when we use them for a long car ride. This bag also can be used as a personal item when flying.

### 2. Interactive Book

Great interactive book- it talks and sings, plus it's bilingual!

### 3. Drawing Pad

This drawing pad is definitely a favorite. It clears its self with the click of a button. The pen stays attached, so no lost parts. Fun to draw with, without any mess.

### 4. Tablet Mount

We try to keep screen time to a minimum. This IPad holder fits fright on the headrest. Typically we try to hold off as long as we can. We will end our drive with some screen time, once everyone's a little on edge and ready to get out of the car.

### 5. Snack Cup

This snack cup is great. Keeps mess to a minimum. My toddler has been using this since he was a baby. Easy for little hands to use.

### 6. Portable Sound Machine

This portable sound machine is perfect to put by my younger baby, to help drown out sounds of our toddler. She also using a sound machine at home, so this helps set the right environment for sleep.

### 8. Portable Speaker

So this portable speaker allows my toddler to listen to music he likes instead of the whole family having to listen. "Wheels on the Bus" is great, until you have to listen to it on repeat. You can also play a kid friendly podcast on the speaker!

### 9. High Contrast Book

### 10. Farm Animals Book

This is another interactive book that my toddler loves. It's got farm animals, counting and pop-it's built in.

### 11. Snackle Box

I've got two words for you, Snackle Box! This is just a fun and easy way to organize your car snacks in a tackle box. I don't give the whole box to my toddler, this is when the snack cup comes in clutch.

## Bonus Item

This is the car seat we have in my husband's truck. We have two, one for each kiddo.

[Car Seat](https://amzn.to/3whXZZ9)

I've got some nuna car seats in my car, but we chose these for my husband's truck. They are good for newborns through school age (5lb-40lb), so we don't have to switch them out as they grow from the newborn stage. They are one of the most lightweight car seats I could find. This makes them great for airplane travel too. We have flown with it before and had no issues. Also easy to clean. The whole cover easily comes off and can be thrown in the washing machine. The price is great with it being under $100.
