Here are some Amazon products we used during our first long car ride with our 2 year old and 2 month old! All links are affiliate links and earn us commission.

1. This is the bag we keep all of our car activities in. We put this away when not in use, that way these toys feel exciting and new when we use them for a long car ride. This bag also can be used as a personal item when flying.

3. This drawing pad is definitely a favorite. It clears its self with the click of a button. The pen stays attached, so no lost parts. Fun to draw with, without any mess.

4. We try to keep screen time to a minimum. This IPad holder fits fright on the headrest. Typically we try to hold off as long as we can. We will end our drive with some screen time, once everyone’s a little on edge and ready to get out of the car.

8. So this portable speaker allows my toddler to listen to music he likes instead of the whole family having to listen. “Wheels on the Bus” is great, until you have to listen to it on repeat. You can also play a kid friendly podcast on the speaker!

11. I’ve got two words for you, Snackle Box! This is just a fun and easy way to organize your car snacks in a tackle box. I don’t give the whole box to my toddler, this is when the snack cup comes in clutch.

Bonus Item:

This is the car seat we have in my husband’s truck. We have two, one for each kiddo.

I’ve got some nuna car seats in my car, but we chose these for my husband’s truck. They are good for newborns through school age (5lb-40lb), so we don’t have to switch them out as they grow from the newborn stage. They are one of the most lightweight car seats I could find. This makes them great for airplane travel too. We have flown with it before and had no issues. Also easy to clean. The whole cover easily comes off and can be thrown in the washing machine. The price is great with it being under $100.
