Packing homemade or thoughtfully chosen snacks for a long car ride with a toddler and baby is a game-changer for keeping everyone happy and stress-free. 

Bringing homemade snacks on a long car ride for your kids have several benefits beyond just keeping them full. Nutritional control is a major advantage—you can ensure the snacks are made with wholesome, natural ingredients without excess sugar, preservatives, or artificial additives found in store-bought options.

Another benefit is cost savings, as making snacks at home is often more affordable than buying pre-packaged toddler snacks. 

Prevents Hunger Meltdowns – Little ones get hungry frequently, and having snacks on hand helps avoid cranky, fussy moments before the next meal stop.

Keeps Kids Entertained – Eating is an activity! Offering bite-sized, slow-eating snacks helps keep little hands busy and makes the ride feel shorter.

Minimizes Mess & Choking Risks – Homemade snacks can be prepared in toddler-friendly, easy-to-hold portions that are less crumbly and safer to eat on the go, helping to keep the car (somewhat) cleaner. Of course, no matter how much I plan ahead, my kids still manage to make a mess! 

From soft granola bars to veggie muffins or their favorite fruits, planning ahead with snacks makes road trips smoother, happier, and more enjoyable for everyone. Here's two go-to recipes for a long car ride!

Adding sourdough starter to granola bars enhances their digestibility and nutritional benefits while giving them a subtle tangy depth of flavor. This version incorporates discard or active sourdough starter, making it a great way to reduce waste while creating a wholesome, toddler-friendly snack!

#### **Ingredients:**

- 1 ¼ cups rolled oats

- ½ cup whole wheat flour

- ¼ cup sourdough starter (discard or active)

- ¼ cup ground flaxseeds  (optional)

- ¼ cup honey or maple syrup (honey only if over 1 year old)

- ¼ cup coconut oil, melted

- ½ tsp vanilla extract

- ¼ tsp cinnamon (optional)

- ¼ cup mini chocolate chips

- ¼ cup finely chopped nuts or sunflower seeds (optional)

- ¼ tsp salt

#### **Instructions:**

- **Preheat oven to 350°F ** and line an 8x8-inch baking dish with parchment paper.

- **Mix dry ingredients**: In a large bowl, combine the oats, whole wheat flour, flaxseeds, cinnamon, and salt.

- **Mix wet ingredients**: In a separate bowl, whisk together the sourdough starter, melted coconut oil, honey (or maple syrup), and vanilla extract.

- **Combine & add chocolate chips**: Pour the wet mixture into the dry ingredients and stir well. Once slightly cooled, fold in the chocolate chips.

- **Press into the pan**: Transfer the mixture to the prepared baking dish and press it down firmly into an even layer.

- **Bake for 18-22 minutes**, or until the edges are golden brown and slightly firm.

- **Cool completely** before slicing—this helps the bars hold their shape.

- **Slice & serve**: Cut into bars or squares and enjoy on your long car ride!

These sourdough granola bars are packed with wholesome ingredients and make a delicious, nutritious snack for toddlers and adults alike!
