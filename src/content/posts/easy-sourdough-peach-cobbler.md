There’s something so comforting about peach cobbler—it’s rustic, simple, and brimming with summer flavor. If you’re like me and not ready for fall yet, I’m hanging onto summer one cobbler at a time. This sourdough version adds a little twist by incorporating active or discard starter, which gives the cobbler base a subtle tang and a tender, cake-like texture. It’s the perfect way to use up a little extra sourdough starter while creating a dessert that feels both nostalgic and special.

What I love most about this recipe is its flexibility. If you’re in a hurry, you can mix everything up and bake it right away. But if you have time, letting the batter ferment at room temperature for several hours deepens the flavor and makes the texture even softer. I’ll usually mix mine in the morning, let it sit all day, and then pop it in the oven just before dinner.

When baked, the batter rises around the juicy peaches, creating golden, sugary edges and soft, fruit-filled pockets throughout. The finishing touch of sprinkling cane sugar on top before baking gives it that irresistible sweet crust. And of course, no cobbler is complete without a scoop of vanilla ice cream melting into every bite.

This recipe works beautifully with fresh peaches at the peak of summer, but you could easily swap in frozen (thawed and drained) when peaches are out of season. It’s the kind of dessert that feels just as at home at a backyard cookout as it does on a cozy night in.

**1) Mix the Dry Ingredients**

What to do: In a medium bowl, whisk together

1 cup all-purpose flour, ¾ cup cane sugar, 1½ tsp baking powder, ½ tsp fine salt

Why it matters: Whisking evenly distributes the baking powder and salt so the cobbler rises uniformly and bakes with a tender, cake-like crumb.

Pro tip: If your sugar clumps in humid weather, sift the flour and sugar first for an ultra-smooth batter.

**2) Add the Wet Ingredients**

What to do: Add and stir until just combined: I like to mix all my wet ingredients together first in a separate bowl and then combine with the dry ingredients.

½ cup sourdough starter (active or discard), 4 Tbsp (½ stick) butter (melted and slightly cooled), 1 tsp vanilla extract

Consistency cues: Batter should be pourable but not thin—think pancake batter. If it seems very thick, add 1–2 tsp water or milk. If it’s runny, rest it 5 minutes to thicken.

Why it matters: Sourdough starter brings gentle tang and tenderness. I like using sourdough discard but active will work great too. Melted butter adds moisture and those caramelized, crispy edges we love. 

**3) (Optional) Long Fermentation Rest**

![](https://bloghalfpintmama.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/img_8813-1.jpg?w=768)

What to do: Cover the bowl and leave at room temperature for 8 hours (4–12 hours works too).

I typically mix in the morning and bake in the evening.

What’s happening: The starter gently ferments the batter, developing flavor and softening the crumb. Double-acting baking powder still gives lift in the oven.

Warm kitchen? If your kitchen is above 78°F, shorten the rest to 4–6 hours. Cooler kitchens can go longer.

Skip it if you want: You can bake right away—still delicious! I definitely prefer a long fermentation for flavor but if you don’t have the time don’t worry about it.

**4) Prep the Peaches**

What to do: Cut about 2 cups of ripe but firm peaches into ½–¾” pieces. Peeling is optional.

If the peaches are very juicy, pat them dry.

Swap options:

Frozen peaches: thaw, drain, and pat dry. Canned (in juice or light syrup): drain very well; if using syrup, reduce batter sugar by 1–2 Tbsp. You can also be creative with it and try out different fruits, we love to do this recipe with blackberries!

**5) Preheat & Prep the Pan**

What to do: Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 2 to 2½-quart baking dish (an 8×8” or 9” round works great) with butter or coconut oil.

Why it matters: A well-greased dish helps that signature golden edge release cleanly.

**6) Assemble**

What to do:

Pour the batter into the prepared dish and spread it evenly. Scatter the peaches across the top—the batter will rise around them as it bakes. Sprinkle ¼ cup cane sugar evenly over everything.

![](https://bloghalfpintmama.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/img_8823.jpg?w=768)

Why the sugar topping? It melts and crisps into a delicate, crackly crust—classic cobbler vibes.

**7) Bake **

What to do: Bake at 350°F for 50–55 minutes, until:

The top is deep golden and crisp at the edges. The center looks set, not liquidy. A toothpick near the center comes out mostly clean (juicy peach bits are fine).

Pan differences: A deeper dish may need an extra 5–10 minutes. If the top browns too fast, tent loosely with foil for the last 10 minutes.

**8) Rest, Serve & Store**

Rest: Let cobbler cool 10–15 minutes so the juices settle.

![](https://bloghalfpintmama.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/img_8830-2.jpg?w=768)

Serve: Warm, with vanilla ice cream or whipped cream.

**Dry Ingredients:**

Store: Cover and refrigerate up to 3 days.

Make-ahead: You can mix the batter and ferment up to 8–10 hours at room temp (or up to 24 hours in the fridge), then assemble and bake. If refrigerated, let batter sit at room temp 20–30 minutes before baking for best rise.

**Troubleshooting & Tweaks**

Cobbler too pale, still jiggly: Bake 5–10 minutes longer; center should no longer wobble. 

Soggy spots: Peaches were overly juicy—next time, pat them dry or add up to 1 tsp flour tossed with the peaches.
