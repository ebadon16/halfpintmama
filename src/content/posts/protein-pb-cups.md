## Ingredients 

![](https://halfpintmama.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-1.jpg?w=1024)

**Oat Mixture**

- 1 & 1/2 Cups of old fashioned oats

- 1/2 Cup maple syrup

- 1 TBSP of coconut oil

(melted if in sold form)

- 1 Scoop of protein powder

We use Ascent (vanilla bean) Whey protein powder

I will explain this more bellow

- 1 Cup of peanut butter

**Chocolate Topping**

- 1 Cup dark chocolate chips

- 2 TBSP coconut oil

## Instructions

Combine all oat mixture ingredients into a bowl, stir together.

Using a muffin tin (we prefer mini size) coat with coconut oil to make non-stick. Can also use muffin liners if you prefer.

Scoop about 1 TBSP of mixture into muffin tin (mini size) and press down with fingers. Repeat until all the mixture is used. 

In a separate bowl combine chocolate and coconut oil. Microwave in increments of 30 seconds. Mixing with spoon in between time frames until fully melted.

Scoop the chocolate mixture and pour on top of the oat cups. Pro tip is using a measuring cup instead to pour the chocolate. Make sure the chocolate covers the top, repeat until all cups are covered.

Put in Freezer for at least 2 hours and enjoy!

We absolutely love this toddler tower. One of my favorite things is that we can wipe it down to clean it. It folds up pretty compact but we typically keep it at the counter. Porter loves helping so this is a necessity!
