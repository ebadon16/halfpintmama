This is one of the “cleanest” protein powders we have found and it taste great without the artificial sweeteners!

We absolutely love this toddler tower. One of my favorite things is that we can wipe it down to clean it. It folds up pretty compact but we typically keep it at the counter. Porter loves helping so this is a necessity!
