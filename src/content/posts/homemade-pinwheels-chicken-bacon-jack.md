Homemade puff pastry + shredded chicken, crisp bacon, and shredded Monterey Jack — flaky, cheesy party bites.

The first time I made these, it was just a simple lunch for my toddlers — and they devoured them. I honestly thought I was going to have to run to the grocery store for puff pastry, but then I realized how simple it is to make it at home. With just a few basic ingredients, you can create buttery, flaky layers that are even better than store-bought.

These pinwheels are the kind of snack that disappears from a plate before you can say "one more!". I originally got the idea for the puff pastry recipe from an [Italian in my kitchen](https://anitalianinmykitchen.com/puff-pastry/), check out her recipe for a more in depth step by step. I'm a little type B in the kitchen but I'll include what I did in this post.

Total time you should plan for (including chilling): 2–3 hours.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

#### Step 1: Make the homemade puff pastry (cold ingredients = key)

![](https://bloghalfpintmama.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/img_8951.jpg?w=768)

You could also buy the already made at the store but I was pleasantly surprised how easy this was to do homemade. In your [food processor](https://amzn.to/4nb5Ywz) pulse together flour and salt. Add the cold cubed butter, I did about 1/2 cup of the cubes for a couple pulses, then added the rest of the butter, pulsed again; don't overwork, don't want to let the food processor heat up. Drizzle 1/2 cup cold water over the mixture, pulse a few more times. I'll fill up a cup with ice water and let the ice melt down a little and use that. On a floured surface I used my hands to kneed the dough just a tiny bit more (not too much because the heat from your hands will work against you). Gather the dough into a rough rectangle, wrap in plastic, and chill 20–30 minutes. This resting helps the gluten relax and keeps the butter cold. You can also try to skip this chill but your dough maybe a little sticky-even a few minutes in the freezer can help.

#### Step 2: Laminate the dough (create the layers)

Lightly flour your work surface. Roll the chilled dough into a rectangle about 12 x 8 inches. Don't worry about perfection. Fold the rectangle into thirds (like a business letter): fold one short side toward the center, then the other over it. Rotate the dough 90°.Now fold into thirds again, making a rough square. Chill the wrapped dough at least 1-2 hours (you can chill longer — overnight is fine).

#### Step 3: Prepare the filling

Cook bacon until crisp, drain on paper towels, then chop into small pieces. If you haven't already, figure out what other meat you would like to use. I did sliced chicken breast because that's what I had on hand but shredded chicken (instant pot or rotisserie chicken) works well. Even any kind of lunch meat would be an easy substitute here.

#### Step 4: Assemble the pinwheel log

On a floured surface, roll the chilled pastry into a rectangle about 12 x 16 inches and roughly 1/8" thick. Keep edges reasonably straight (I'm not the best at this) so the log rolls nicely. Spread the filling evenly over the pastry, leaving a 1/2" clean border. Don't overfill — a thin, even layer is better. I did chicken, bacon and then cheese. You could add any veggies you want here too. Starting at the near long edge, roll the pastry tightly into a log (jelly-roll style) so the seam ends up on the bottom. Use gentle, even pressure — the tighter the roll, the prettier the spiral. Wrap the log in plastic and chill at least 20–30 minutes (longer is okay). Chilling firms the log so you can slice cleanly without smashing the layers.

#### Step 5: Slice and bake

![](https://bloghalfpintmama.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/img_8966.jpg?w=768)

Preheat the oven to 375°F . Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Or use this [baking sheet](https://amzn.to/4nkAHqT) that I love, it's non-toxic and non-stick so you don't have to line. Unwrap the chilled log. Using a sharp knife or [bench scraper](https://amzn.to/48jT4HO), slice the log into rounds about 3/4-1/2" thick. Cut gently in a single motion to avoid compressing the spiral. Place pinwheels on the baking sheet cut side up, spaced about 1" apart. Sprinkle the top with leftover shredded cheese. Bake about 16–22 minutes, until the pastry is puffed and deep golden. Cool 5 minutes on the baking sheet, then transfer to a rack for a few more minutes — they're delicious warm.

## Tips, Troubleshooting & Make-Ahead

- **Butter too soft?** Chill the dough 15–30 minutes before continuing.
- **Cold butter = flaky layers.**
- **Seeping filling:** Don't overfill. Pre-drain any very moist chicken.
- **Slicing cleanly:** Very cold log + sharp knife or bench scraper. If slices squish, chill longer.
- **Make-ahead pastry:** The dough (after making and doing turns) can be wrapped and frozen for up to 1 month. Thaw overnight in the fridge before rolling.
- **Freeze raw pinwheels:** After slicing, place the raw pinwheels on a baking sheet and freeze until solid. Transfer to a freezer bag or airtight container. Bake straight from frozen at 375°F, adding 4–6 minutes to the baking time.
- **Freeze baked pinwheels:** These reheat beautifully for toddler lunches or quick snacks. Let them cool fully, then freeze in a single layer before bagging. Warm in a 350°F oven for 6–8 minutes (or in an air fryer for 3–4 minutes) until crisp again.
- **Store in fridge:** Refrigerate baked pinwheels up to 3 days.

## Variations & Serving Ideas

- **Toddler/lunchbox friendly:** Bake a double batch and freeze half — then you'll always have a quick, homemade "grab and reheat" option for lunches or after-school snacks.
- **Cheese swap:** Keep it simple with Monterey Jack, or add half pepper Jack for a touch of spice if your crew likes heat.
- **Veggie boost:** Stir in a handful of finely chopped spinach, bell pepper, or broccoli with the filling for extra nutrition (a great way to sneak in veggies for kids).
- **Dips:** Serve with ranch, honey mustard, or a mild salsa — kids especially love a little dip with each bite.
