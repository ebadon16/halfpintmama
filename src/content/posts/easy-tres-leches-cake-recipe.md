## **My Mom's Tres Leches Cake**

My mother has been making this for years, and it has become a centerpiece of celebrations, holidays, and quiet weekends alike. I'm honored to be able to share it here, with her blessing.

Tres Leches, or “three milks,” is a Latin American classic—ultra-moist, rich but not heavy, and topped with pillowy whipped cream. And while many versions use scratch-made sponge cakes, my mom’s trusted shortcut with boxed yellow cake mix keeps it approachable and just as delicious.

Let’s walk through it together.

### **Step-by-Step**

#### **Ingredients**

**For the Cake**

- 1 box Betty Crocker® SuperMoist® yellow cake mix

- 1 1/4 cups water

- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil

- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract

- 4 eggs

**For the Glaze (the "tres leches")**

- 1 (12-ounce) can evaporated milk

- 1 (14-ounce) can sweetened condensed milk

- 1 cup half-and-half

**For the Whipped Topping**

- 2 cups heavy whipping cream

- 2 tablespoons powdered sugar

- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

- Optional: sliced fresh strawberries or cinnamon for garnish

### **Step 1: Bake the Cake**

Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (or 325°F if you’re using a dark or nonstick pan). Prepare a 13x9-inch pan by greasing it.

In a large bowl, combine the cake mix, water, oil, vanilla, and eggs. Use an electric mixer or stand up mixer on low speed for 30 seconds to combine, then increase to medium speed and beat for 2 minutes. Scrape the bowl occasionally to make sure everything’s fully incorporated.

Pour the batter into the prepared pan and smooth it out evenly.

Bake according to the directions on the box for a 13x9-inch pan—typically around 30–35 minutes. The top should be golden and spring back lightly when touched.

### **Step 2: Soak with the Three Milks**

Once the cake is out of the oven, let it rest for just 5 minutes. While it’s still hot, use a chop stick (could also use a long-tined fork) to poke holes all over the top of the cake—about every 1/2 inch. Wipe the chop stick/fork clean occasionally to avoid tearing the cake.

In a separate bowl, stir together the evaporated milk, sweetened condensed milk, and half-and-half. This is the magic blend that gives the cake its unmistakable texture and flavor.

Slowly and carefully pour the milk mixture evenly over the cake, making sure it gets into every nook and cranny. Don’t worry if it pools a bit on top—it will soak in as it chills.

Cover the cake with foil or plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or until the milks are fully absorbed. Overnight is even better if you have the time.

### **Step 3: Make the Whipped Topping**

Right before serving (or just before guests arrive), make the whipped cream topping. In a chilled mixing bowl, beat the heavy cream with powdered sugar and vanilla until soft peaks form. Spread it generously over the cold, soaked cake.

For an extra touch, top with fresh sliced strawberries or a sprinkle of ground cinnamon.

### **Storage Tip:**

This cake gets better as it sits! Store any leftovers covered in the fridge for up to 3–4 days. It’s delicious cold. What makes it even more special is that I can prepare the whole thing the night before. In fact, I love making this recipe when we have guests over because all the prep is done in advance, and the cake only gets better as it chills. That means less time in the kitchen and more time enjoying good company.
