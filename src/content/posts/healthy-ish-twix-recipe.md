If you've been craving something sweet but still want to keep things wholesome, these Healthy Twix Bars with Dates are about to be your new favorite treat! They capture all the magic of the classic Twix bar — a crunchy shortbread base, a gooey caramel layer, and a rich chocolate topping — but they're naturally sweetened with dates, gluten-free, and made without refined sugars. Plus, they're no-bake, which means you can whip them up easily without ever turning on the oven. I especially love making these with my toddler, who enjoys helping press the shortbread into the pan and sneaking little tastes of the date caramel. It's a fun and easy recipe to involve little ones in the kitchen! Perfect for a snack, dessert, or even a sneaky breakfast treat!

In a bowl, combine 1 cup almond flour (or oat flour for nut-free), 2 tablespoons maple syrup, 2 tablespoons melted coconut oil, 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract and a pinch of salt. Mix until it's crumbly but the dough can be pressed down.

Press the dough firmly into a small parchment-lined loaf pan or dish. Chill in the freezer while you prepare the caramel.

#### Caramel Layer (Date-Based)

Prepare 1 cup of Medjool dates by removing the pit/seed and letting them soften up in hot water. Drain the water and move the dates to the food processor.

In a food processor, blend 1 cup softened Medjool dates, 2 tablespoons peanut butter (really any nut or seed butter will work), 1-2 tablespoons of milk (I used whole milk because I had it on hand but any plant milk or even water would work), 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract, and a pinch of salt. Blend until very smooth and creamy, scraping down sides as needed.

Spread the caramel evenly over the chilled shortbread base. Freeze for about 45 minutes until firm.

Once firm, slice into bars.

#### Chocolate Layer (DIY Chocolate Option)

You can either make your own chocolate layer or melt dark chocolate chips with a little coconut oil.

To make your own in a small bowl, melt 1/4 cup coconut oil. Whisk in 1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder and 2-3 tablespoons maple syrup to taste.

Alternatively, melt about 3/4 cup dark chocolate chips with 1 teaspoon coconut oil until smooth.

Dip the firmed caramel-topped shortbread bars into the chocolate to coat the top, letting any excess drip off. I did it both ways with coating the entire bar in chocolate and then did some that just coated the top date layer, so whichever you would like. 

Chill again for about 20–30 minutes until the chocolate is set.

Store in the fridge for up to a week or freeze for longer storage.
