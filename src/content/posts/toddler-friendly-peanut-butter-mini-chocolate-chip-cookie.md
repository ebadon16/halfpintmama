Making healthy treats for my toddler is something we both enjoy doing! My three year old is always involved in the preparation. We both have quite the sweet tooth so I am always making up healthy alternatives to get "our fix". Swapping out refined sugar for natural sweeteners helps develop their taste for wholesome flavors without the extra sugar. Plus, involving my toddler in the baking process adds an extra layer of excitement and encourages him to try new foods!

These peanut butter mini chocolate chip cookies are made with almond flour are a delicious, guilt-free treat that satisfies your sweet tooth without added sugar or artificial ingredients. Made with simple ingredients and they're easy to prepare.

Preheat your oven to 350°F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. In a mixing bowl, combine all the ingredients and mix together until a dough forms.

One great thing about this dough is there is no raw eggs so it is safe to eat. My toddler is pretty fast to tryout what he's mixing together.

Gently fold in the dark chocolate chips.

We scooped roughly 1.5 tablespoon-sized portions of the dough with a cookie scoop onto the prepared baking sheet. You could also roll into a ball with your hands. Then flatten slightly with a fork in a criss-cross pattern. Or you can use your fingers or the back of a spoon. Feel free to make these as small or large as you would like. The criss-cross pattern gives it a classic peanut butter cookie look.

Bake for about 8-10 minutes at 350°F. You want the edges to be browned

Let them cool and now they are ready to enjoy!

These cookies are naturally gluten-free, grain-free, and naturally sweetened, making them a wholesome treat. They are soft and chewy-perfect for kids and adults alike! Store them in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days or in the fridge for up to a week.

## **Baking with a Toddler**

Baking with a toddler is equal parts joyful and messy, turning a simple recipe into a delightful adventure. Little hands eager to pour, stir, and sneak tastes make the kitchen come alive with laughter and curiosity. Measuring ingredients becomes a mini math lesson, it is practice with dexterity and a sensory activity like no other. While flour might end up on the floor as much as in the bowl, these spills and smudges create memories just as sweet as the treats themselves. I am always so amazed what little humans can do with practice and a little patience. Baking with a toddler may take a bit longer, but it's filled with so many amazing moments.

We absolutely love this toddler tower. One of my favorite things is that we can wipe it down to clean it. It folds up pretty compact but we typically keep it at the counter.
