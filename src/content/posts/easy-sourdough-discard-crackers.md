Perfectly crispy, simple, and oh so addicting.

These easy sourdough discard crackers are a simple, no-waste recipe you can make in under 25 minutes. Not only are these homemade but endlessly customizable! No fancy ingredients, no long fermentation, no fuss. Just your leftover discard, a little seasoning, and 20 minutes in the oven.

If you’ve been baking sourdough for a while, you know the discard adds up fast. Instead of tossing it (because that feels just plain wrong), turn it into the crispiest, most flavorful little snack.

What You’ll Need

Sourdough discard (any amount works- depending on your baking sheet size)

[Everything bagel seasoning](https://amzn.to/47r4PKm) (or your favorite seasoning blend)

[Parchment paper](https://amzn.to/477OprA)

[Baking sheet](https://amzn.to/4qyjDQo)

How to Make Them

Preheat your oven to 350°F and line a [baking sheet](https://amzn.to/4qyjDQo) with [parchment paper](https://amzn.to/477OprA).

Spread out your sourdough discard directly onto the [parchment paper](https://amzn.to/477OprA).

Go as thin as you can. Honestly the thinner, the crispier the crackers will be.

Sprinkle on your seasoning. [Everything bagel](https://amzn.to/47r4PKm) is my go-to, but you can get creative! Try: Garlic & rosemary Sea salt & cracked black pepper Parmesan & Italian herbs Cinnamon sugar (for a sweet twist).

Bake for 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and cut or tear into cracker-sized pieces. You can use [kitchen scissors](https://amzn.to/47uxbn7), a knife, or even a [pizza cutter](https://amzn.to/49jSHgO) all work great. I’ve also just broken them apart with my hands before too.

Bake for another 10 minutes, or until golden brown and crisp. Keep a close eye near the end since every oven is a little different.

Let them cool completely before storing (if you don’t eat them all first!). They’ll stay crunchy in an airtight container for up to a week.

Why I Love This Recipe

This is the kind of homestead-style recipe I can make right here in my suburban kitchen. It’s simple, no-waste, and oh so satisfying. It’s one of those little wins that makes learning new skills feel doable, even without acres of land or a full farmhouse kitchen (yet!).
