Soft, pillowy, and made with real ingredients, these homemade sourdough tortillas are easier than you think. You're going to have a hard time going back to  store bought!

Once you start making tortillas at home, it's hard to go back. There's something about a warm, fresh tortilla that just hits different. These sourdough tortillas have become a staple in our house—perfect for taco night, quesadillas, or a lunch wrap.

I love that this recipe uses simple pantry ingredients and my trusty sourdough starter. No weird additives, no seed oils, just real food. And the best part? They come together pretty quickly once you get the hang of it.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

**Step 1: Combine the dry ingredients**

![](https://bloghalfpintmama.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/img_0820.jpg?w=768)

In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, and baking powder until evenly distributed. Make a well in the center—like you're creating a little crater in the middle of your dry ingredients. This is where the magic happens.

**Step 2: Mix the wet ingredients**

![](https://bloghalfpintmama.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/img_0821.jpg?w=768)

In a separate small bowl, combine your sourdough starter, olive oil, and warm water. Give it a good stir until everything is mixed together.

**Step 3: Bring it all together**

![](https://bloghalfpintmama.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/img_0824.jpg?w=768)

Pour the wet mixture into the center of your well. Using a [Danish whisk](https://amzn.to/4qzV44Z) (or wooden spoon), start mixing from the center outward, gradually incorporating the flour until a shaggy dough forms.

**Step 4: Knead the dough**

![](https://bloghalfpintmama.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/img_0826.jpg?w=768)

Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface. Knead by hand for 2–3 minutes until the dough is smooth and comes together nicely. It shouldn't be sticky—if it is, add a little more flour as you knead.

**Step 5: Divide into portions**

![](https://bloghalfpintmama.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/img_0827.jpg?w=768)

Using a [dough cutter](https://amzn.to/4sZ9kGg), divide your dough into 16 equal pieces. If you want them to be exactly even, this is a great time to pull out your [kitchen scale](https://amzn.to/469aQvo).

> 
Each piece should weigh about 44g.

**Step 6: Roll into balls**

![](https://bloghalfpintmama.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/img_0828.jpg?w=768)

Take each piece and roll it into a smooth ball. I like to pinch the underside together first, then do some push and pulls (kind of like when shaping a sourdough loaf) to create a nice, smooth, round ball. Repeat for all 16 pieces.

**Step 7: Let them rest**

Place all your dough balls on a clean floured surface and cover with a [dish towel](https://amzn.to/4raadKd). Let them rest for about 20 minutes. This lets the gluten relax and makes rolling so much easier (trust me on this one).

> 
Optional long fermentation option: After the 20-minute rest, you can move your dough balls to a baking sheet and cover with plastic wrap. Pop them in the fridge for 12–24 hours before rolling and cooking.

I bake these both ways—with and without the long fermentation. It really just depends on how much you planned ahead! But if you have the time, the longer ferment makes them extra gut-friendly and gives you that added sourdough benefit we love.

**Step 8: Roll out the tortillas**

![](https://bloghalfpintmama.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/img_0830.jpg?w=768)

On a lightly floured surface, take each ball and use a [rolling pin](https://amzn.to/3NwM0PO) to roll it flat into roughly a 6-inch tortilla. Work from the center outward, rotating as you go.

*A note on pressing:* I've tried cast iron tortilla presses, and honestly, hand rolling works way better for me. You get more control and a better result.

**Important:** Don't stack your rolled tortillas directly on top of each other, they will stick! Instead, line a baking sheet with [parchment paper](https://amzn.to/4rbpo64), lay down your tortillas, add another layer of parchment, and repeat until they're all rolled out.

**Step 9: Cook the tortillas**

Heat your [cast iron skillet](https://amzn.to/4pOFYY3) (or [Blackstone griddle](https://amzn.to/4a5XgeG)) over **medium heat**. Add a light coating of olive oil.

![](https://bloghalfpintmama.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/img_0835.jpg?w=768)

Place a tortilla on the hot surface and cook for about **50 seconds to 1 minute** until you see nice bubbles forming on top. Flip and cook for just **20–30 seconds** more.

Transfer to a plate and cover with a clean dish towel to keep them warm and soft while you cook the rest.

*Pro tip:* If you have multiple cast iron skillets, put them all on the stove to create multiple cooking stations. Or, my absolute favorite method is using my Blackstone—I can turn out so many tortillas so quickly!

## Storage Tips

![](https://bloghalfpintmama.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/image-4-1.jpg?w=1024)

**Room Temperature:** Store in an airtight container or zip-top bag at room temperature for up to 2 days. 

**Refrigerator:** For longer storage, keep them in the fridge for up to 1 week. Let them come to room temperature before reheating for the best texture.

**Freezer:** These freeze beautifully! Stack the cooled tortillas with parchment paper between each one, then place in a freezer-safe bag. Squeeze out as much air as possible. They'll keep for up to 3 months.

> 
To reheat from frozen, you can either let them thaw in the fridge overnight or heat them directly from frozen in a dry skillet over medium heat for about 30 seconds per side.

## Troubleshooting Tips

![](https://bloghalfpintmama.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/image-1-1.jpg?w=1024)

***My tortillas are too thick.*** Roll them thinner! The dough is forgiving. If they're springing back too much, let them rest a few more minutes before rolling again.

***They're not puffing up when cooking.*** Make sure your pan is hot enough. Medium heat should do it, but every stove is different. You want to see those bubbles form within the first minute.

***The dough is too sticky.*** Add a bit more flour while kneading. The dough should be smooth and slightly tacky but not sticking to your hands.

***They're coming out stiff.*** You might be overcooking them, it really does not take much. Keep that second side to just 20–30 seconds. Also, keeping them covered with a towel while they're warm helps them stay soft.

## Final Thoughts

Homemade tortillas are one of those things that feel fancy but are actually super simple. Once you make them a few times, it becomes second nature. The sourdough adds a little extra flavor and that gut-friendly benefit we love. Plus my kids devour them.
