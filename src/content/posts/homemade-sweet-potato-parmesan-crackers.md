Making homemade sweet potato crackers for my toddler is a fun and nutritious way to offer a crunchy, wholesome snack without preservatives or artificial ingredients. These crackers are packed with vitamins from the sweet potato, fiber from whole grains, and a hint of natural sweetness that little ones love. By baking them at home, you can control the ingredients, adjust the texture for tiny teeth, and even add flavors like mild spices or cheese for variety. This particular recipe adds in some parmesan cheese!

Preheat your oven to 350°F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper or silicone  baking sheet. In a mixing bowl, combine your wet ingredients- the melted coconut oil and smashed sweet potato. In another bowl combine your dry ingredients- flour, salt and baking powder. Mix your dry ingredients into your wet ingredients and add in the parmesan cheese.

Mix dough together with your hands. At this point if your dough is too sticky add a little more flour; if too dry, add a tsp of water at a time.

Use a knife or small cookie cutters to create cracker shapes—I love using fun shapes to make them extra exciting for my toddler!

Let the crackers cool completely before serving. They will crisp up a bit more as they cool.

 Keep in an airtight container for up to 5 days, or freeze for up to 3 months.

The Parmesan adds a deliciously savory touch while keeping the crackers nutritious and toddler-friendly!
