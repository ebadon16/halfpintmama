Making healthy treats for my toddler is something we both enjoy doing! My two and a half year old is always involved in the preparation. We both have quite the sweet tooth so I am always making up healthy alternatives to get "our fix". Simple ingredients like oats, bananas, yogurt, and berries become the foundation for so many of our delicious snacks. Swapping out sugar for natural sweeteners helps develop their taste for wholesome flavors without the extra sugar.  Plus, involving my toddler in the baking process adds an extra layer of excitement and encourages him to try new foods! 

These peanut butter truffles are a delicious, guilt-free treat that satisfies your sweet tooth without added sugar or artificial ingredients. Made with simple ingredients, they’re easy to prepare and packed with protein. These truffles are perfect for a quick snack or dessert, delivering a rich, creamy taste with each bite. Best of all, they can be made in minutes and stored in the fridge for whenever you need a wholesome energy boost!

- 1/4 Cup Swerve powder sugar

- 1/4 Cup milk & 2 TBSP*

We used whole milk because we had it but almond milk would work as well

- * the 2 TBSP of added milk gets it to the right consistency for, depending on specific brands you use this may have to be adjusted 

**Chocolate Topping**

- 1 Cup dark chocolate chips

We used Bake Believe Dark chocolate from Costco 

- 1 TBSP coconut oil (optional)

## Instructions

Combine all dry ingredients into a bowl and then stir together. One great thing about this dough is there is no raw eggs so it is safe to eat. My toddler is pretty fast to tryout what he's mixing together.

Add milk at this time and stir. Continue to stir and add additional TBSP of milk one at a time to get the right consistency. For us this took 2 additional TBSP of milk. I think almond milk would be great, we just always have whole milk at home so that is what we used.

Roll into balls and place on parchment paper lined baking sheet. I would say we did roughly about 1 TBSP size, but you can make these as small or big as you would like. Just remember they will get a little larger once dipped in chocolate. Place in the refrigerator for 1 hour. This hardens the dough balls a little and makes them easier to handle when dipping in the chocolate.

Melt down dark chocolate. Either on the stove or in the microwave at 30 second intervals (stirring in between). I had to add a little coconut oil because my dark chocolate was a little thick on its own, this is optional. Looking back, I was using a healthier chocolate chip. It did not have any added oils or sugar and I believe this is why my chocolate didn't melt down as thin.

After the dough balls have cooled in the refrigerator, using a fork dip them into the melted dark chocolate. Covering the entire ball with chocolate on all sides. Let excess chocolate drip off and set back on parchment paper lined baking sheet. Fully allowing excess chocolate to drip off prevents the truffles from having bottoms or look like a "hat". Once all balls are covered in chocolate return to parchment paper covered baking sheet and put in the fridge for about 2 hours.

Now they are ready to enjoy!

Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator.

### Baking with a Toddler

Baking with a toddler is equal parts joyful and messy, turning a simple recipe into a delightful adventure. Little hands eager to pour, stir, and sneak tastes make the kitchen come alive with laughter and curiosity. Measuring ingredients becomes a mini math lesson, it is practice with dexterity and a sensory activity like no other. While flour might end up on the floor as much as in the bowl, these spills and smudges create memories just as sweet as the treats themselves. I am always so amazed what little humans can do with practice and a little patience. Baking with a toddler may take a bit longer, but it’s filled with so many amazing moments.

We absolutely love this toddler tower. One of my favorite things is that we can wipe it down to clean it. It folds up pretty compact but we typically keep it at the counter. Porter loves helping so this is a necessity!
