## Why we love it!

So this is the Boon Pivot Toddler Tower! The best thing is this tower is plastic so you can wipe it down to clean it. So many towers are bulky and wooden and this one is neither. It folds up pretty compact but we typically keep it at the counter.

### Makes cooking easier

Porter loves helping so this is a necessity! It actually freed up my hands while cooking. Instead of him wanting to be held, he would rather stand on the toddler tower and help. Got to love toddlers and their want for independence. My little man loves a job and he helps with all the mixing and pouring he can! This toddler tower definitely makes that possible.

### Durable

I find that it's very sturdy and has never tipped on us. Even with the occasional toddler melt down. I can attest that the tower holds up nicely while a 2 year old throws his body around and dramatically throws himself to the floor.

### Mealtime

We recently started using it for the occasional mealtime, instead of his high chair. Due to breastfeeding a newborn again, this is a much safer option during some mealtimes. With the high chair we risk him standing up and falling before I can get to him. The tower has been great when both kiddos want to eat at the same time.

### Con

It is a little pricey and can seem like a lot for a specialty stool. However, I personally think it's worth it. It's the perfect height for our kitchen counters and the safety rail gives me a piece of mind.

**Overall we absolutely love this toddler tower and highly recommend.**
