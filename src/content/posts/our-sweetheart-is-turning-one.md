Our sweetheart is turning ONE, and our hearts are overflowing with love! It feels like just yesterday we held her tiny hands for the first time, and now she’s filling our days with giggles, snuggles, and endless joy. To celebrate this special milestone, we’re embracing all things sweet and rosy with a Valentine’s-themed first birthday! From heart-shaped treats to pink and red décor, we’re showering our little love with all the affection she’s given us this past year. Watching her grow has been the greatest gift, and we can’t wait to see what the next year holds for our precious Valentine!

Our color palette was a dreamy mix of pinks, reds, whites, and a touch of orange. Above the table, I hung a mini balloon arch that I made, filled with various shades of pink, along with handmade garlands ([post on DIY garlands](https://bloghalfpintmama.wordpress.com/2025/01/28/diy-valentines-garlands/)). To add a sentimental touch, I decorated our windows with heart-shaped doilies, each displaying a monthly picture of our little sweetheart ([Heart Monthly Photo DIY Video](https://www.instagram.com/p/DFdNrPzOCbF)). This not only tied in beautifully with the Valentine’s theme but also created the perfect backdrop for photos and the special cake-cutting moment.

The dessert table featured a fun checkered tablecloth as the foundation, adding a playful yet charming touch to the setup. At the center was an adorable chocolate birthday cake topped with tiny hearts, alongside her very own chocolate smash cake ([Sourdough Chocolate Cake recipe I used](https://www.farmhouseonboone.com/sourdough-chocolate-cake/)). Surrounding the cakes were mini heart-shaped sugar cookies designed to resemble conversation hearts, adding a sweet and nostalgic detail ([sugar cookie recipe I used](https://chelsweets.com/conversation-heart-cookies/)).

For table décor, I kept things simple yet elegant with Valentine’s-themed centerpieces. I used clear vases from the Dollar Tree, filling them with mini bouquets of flowers that matched our color scheme. To keep things budget-friendly but still beautiful, I bought $4 bouquets from Walmart and arranged them myself. These little floral touches brought everything together and added just the right amount of charm to our love-filled celebration.

She wore the sweetest little outfit, perfect for her first birthday photos. I got a pink flare romper from Amazon ([Romper Link](https://amzn.to/4hia2Ip)) and hand embroidered a "ONE" on the front.

Every little detail came together to create a space filled with love, warmth, and celebration—exactly how we wanted to honor our little one’s first year.
