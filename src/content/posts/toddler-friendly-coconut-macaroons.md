In a stand up mixer, combine the egg whites, maple syrup, vanilla extract, and salt (optional) until slightly frothy. Add the shredded coconut (unsweetened) with silicone spatula until everything is well coated. You could also use an electric hand mixer or whisk by hand. You just want to make sure your egg white mixture is frothy before adding the shredded coconut.

Using a small spoon, cookie scoop (we used about 1.5 tbsp size scoop) or your hands, scoop out small portions and gently press them into little mounds on the baking sheet.

Bake for about 11-14 minutes at 325°F. You want the edges to be browned

Let them cool completely- they will firm up a little as they cool and now they are ready to enjoy!

These can be stored in a airtight container for up to 3 days at room temperature or in the fridge for up to a week.
