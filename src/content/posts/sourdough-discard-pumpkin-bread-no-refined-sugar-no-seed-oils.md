### Step-by-Step Sourdough Discard Pumpkin Bread

**Step 1: Prepare your ingredients and pan**
Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Lightly grease a standard 9x5" loaf pan with coconut oil or line it with parchment paper for easy removal.

**Step 2: Add the wet ingredients**

- 1/2 cup sourdough discard (unfed)

- 2/3 cup of pumpkin purée

- 1 egg

- 1/3 cup melted coconut oil

- 1/2 cup maple syrup

- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Stir until everything is smooth and well combined. The mixture should look creamy and slightly glossy.

**Step 3: Mix the dry ingredients separately**
In a medium bowl, whisk together:

- 1 cup all-purpose flour

- 2 teaspoon cinnamon 

- 1/2  teaspoon of pumpkin spice

- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda

- 1/4 teaspoons of nutmeg

- 1/4 teaspoon of salt

This step ensures even distribution of the leavening agent.

**Step 4: Combine wet and dry ingredients**
Gently add the dry ingredients into the wet. Stir with a spatula or wooden spoon until just combined. Be careful not to overmix—you want the batter to stay tender.

**Step 5: Pour and smooth**
Transfer the batter to your prepared loaf pan and smooth the top with a spatula.

**Step 6: Bake**
Place in the preheated oven and bake for **50 minutes**, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean or with just a few crumbs. If the top is browning too quickly, tent it with foil in the last 10 minutes.

**Step 7: Cool and enjoy**
Let the pumpkin bread cool in the pan for 10–15 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack. Slice once cooled—or sneak a warm slice if you just can’t wait. I love adding a little butter to my slice while it’s still hot!

**Storage:** Keeps 2–3 days at room temp, or up to 1 week in the fridge. Freezes beautifully in slices.
