Last minute DIY Halloween costume for baby!

It’s a spider🕷️🕸️

I was not prepared for my toddler to have opinions on what he wanted to be for Halloween. So I had absolutely no say in him being Spider-Man. Thank goodness I have an eight month old who I can still dress up. I love a good DIY costume, but was trying to figure out some way to coordinate the kids costumes as well. So my daughter is going to be the spider that bit Spider-Man 🤣 This would also be cute as a take on the itsy-bitsy spider!

**Materials/Tools needed…**

Really I just used a black long sleeve onesie, black embroidery thread, a needle, black socks, and some newspaper plus a bow with spiderwebs on it.

I have everything saved in my Amazon storefront

- Really any one will work, we liked this one because it has the built in hand covers and it’s a buttery soft material for a good price

- Embroidery Floss

**Step by step**

I cut down the black socks because they were too long.

I then stuffed the socks with newspaper, but you could really use anything. Tissue paper would work too.

 I closed that together with some black embroidery thread and a needle but again you could probably use anything. You could probably hot glue it if you wanted to.

Then I attached the sock legs to the onesie, two on each side of the torso.

They were very floppy after this, so I added embroidery thread to connect the sleeve to the sock and then the sock to the second sock. I actually think I’m gonna go in and do this again a little further down on the limbs to help give it a little more stabilization.

Finishing everything off with a bow that has spiderwebs on it. If I was creating a boy version of this, I would add a black beanie with some glued on googly eyes, but I wanted to make it cutesy for my little girl.
