We visited Banff in November with our baby (9 months old) and toddler (almost 3 years old), and it truly felt like stepping into a postcard. Everywhere we looked was breathtaking, and I couldn't stop telling my husband that it felt like we were in a winter wonderland. Since we went in late November, around Thanksgiving, the town was beautifully adorned with Christmas decorations, adding to the festive charm. November in Banff offers a magical experience as the town transitions into a snowy paradise. However, it's worth noting that some winter activities, such as sleigh rides, tubing, and dog sledding, don't begin until mid-December. On the bright side, November means smaller crowds, which made it much easier to enjoy the town's charm and family-friendly attractions at a relaxed pace. In this post, I'll be sharing the activities we enjoyed, where we stayed, and some overall recommendations for visiting Banff with little ones!

## Where We Stayed

We actually stayed at 3 different hotels during our trip. We definitely splurged on accommodations so keep that in mind. Overall Banff can get a little pricey, I found this to be pretty prevalent in where we stayed and food/drinks. The locations of our hotels were such a connivence that I was okay with spending more. Due to location we were able to skip on a car rental which was great. We primarily relied on public transportation with the bus system and lots of walking. We did have a car service from the airport. There are no Ubers/Lifts in Banff and really just one taxi service. We used this when going from the Mount Royal hotel to the Rimrock since we had lots of luggage.

### The Marriott at the Calgary Airport

*This was the view from our first hotel. Everyone was obsessed with watching all the planes!*

Our flight got in pretty late the first night so it was very convenient to stay at a hotel at the Calgary airport. We didn't even have to go outside, the hotel was near the baggage claim. We didn't stay here long but were happy with the room size. The breakfast at the hotel restaurant was pretty good as well.

### Mount Royal Hotel

This hotel is essentially located on Banff's Main Street, and the location is unbeatable—a perfect 10/10. The rooms, however, felt a bit small when accommodating a pack 'n play for my baby and my toddler's inflatable mattress. Something to keep in mind if you're traveling with kids- there's no bathtub, only a walk-in shower (though my kids actually enjoy showers, so it worked out fine for us).

My husband and I were a fan of the hotel bar—we loved their boozy take on hot chocolate, which was a part of the Banff Hot Chocolate Trail. I also read great reviews about the hotel restaurant, which is connected to the bar, though we didn't get a chance to try it ourselves. The hotel features a rooftop hot tub, which sounded amazing, but we didn't have the opportunity to check it out during our stay with the kids. Overall, we stayed here for two nights and enjoyed the convenience and amenities.

### The Rimrock

This was our final hotel stay, and we were here for three nights. It was by far the nicest hotel of our trip, nestled more deeply in the stunning Canadian Rockies. The hotel offers a complimentary shuttle to and from downtown Banff, making it easy to explore without worrying about parking. Additionally, the Banff Gondola is conveniently within walking distance.

The rooms were quite spacious, with plenty of room for our kids' sleeping arrangements. The hotel restaurant, *The Primrose*, served excellent food and an even better breakfast. The room service was pretty pricey but, the convenience of letting the kids eat in the room was worth it. We also enjoyed relaxing at *The Larkspur Lounge*, where we sipped on a delicious boozy hot chocolate by a cozy fireplace. Overall, it was a luxurious and family-friendly stay that added to the magic of our trip!

## Things to Do

The snow-capped peaks and frosty air create the perfect setting for family-friendly activities. With fewer crowds and plenty of activities, Banff in November is a magical and memorable destination for families. These are just a few top picks while in this winter wonderland!

### The Banff Hot Chocolate Trail

This is a delightful experience that invites visitors to explore the town while indulging in some of the best hot chocolate creations. This self-guided trail showcases a variety of unique and decadent hot chocolate recipes, ranging from classic to boozy and everything in between. Our top picks were both boozy and actually at the hotels we stayed at (the Brazen and the Larkspur Lounge).

### The Christmas Market

You'll need tickets to visit, and I recommend purchasing them in advance. When we went, tickets were roughly $15 per adult, with kids aged 2 and under getting in free and ages 3–10 for $10. The event featured several charming areas set up with shops and food/drink options. There were about three separate sections of adorable little shops to explore.

Santa was there during the weekend we visited, and the kids had a blast! My toddler got to share his wish list with Santa, and we even snapped some sweet pictures. For adults, there were a few bar areas, and I highly recommend trying the mulled wine—it was perfect for the chilly weather. Outdoors, we enjoyed live music and cozy fire pits to gather around. Overall, it was a fun experience, though the kids started to wind down toward the end. It's definitely worth checking out, especially for the festive atmosphere and family-friendly vibe.

### The Gondola

The gondola ride itself was so exciting for my kiddos. We had panoramic windows to take in the breathtaking snow-covered peaks as we ascended Sulphur Mountain. At the summit, there are heated indoor spaces, interactive exhibits, and an observation deck where the whole family can enjoy 360-degree views of the Canadian Rockies. Bundle up and explore the boardwalk at the top, or warm up with some yummy food at the Sky Bistro. I was pleasantly surprised by the Sky Bistro. They had not only delicious dishes but also incredible views to accompany your meal. A reservation for the Sky Bistro may be needed and don't forget to buy your tickets for the Gondola before hand.

### In Search of Christmas Spirit

![](https://bloghalfpintmama.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/img_2802-1.jpg?w=768)

This enchanting outdoor storytelling event takes you on a journey through a beautifully lit forest, featuring stunning light displays and a heartwarming holiday tale. Kids will be captivated by the vibrant lights and festive atmosphere, and the short walk makes it manageable even for little ones. My toddler did great walking the trail by himself and my baby was happily on my chest in her carrier.  Don't forget to bundle up because the entire exhibit is outside. The event is free but it does require tickets so don't forget to make your reservation online before.

## Noteworthy Food

We were seriously impressed with the food Banff has to offer—I can honestly say there wasn't a single dish we didn't enjoy. Here are just a few of our favorites. For breakfast, *Melissa's MisSteak* served an incredible eggs Benedict. At *The Primrose* restaurant at The Rimrock, the creme brulee was an absolute 10/10. *Shoku Izakaya* was another standout—this Japanese restaurant had amazing sushi, and my husband raved about their ramen. One of our top picks was *Sky Bistro* at the top of the Banff Gondola, where we enjoyed gourmet dishes paired with stunning panoramic views. In addition to all the boozy hot chocolate we indulged in, we discovered a Canadian drink called the Shaft—a vodka iced coffee that quickly became a favorite. The best one we tried was at *Three Bears Brewery*. Banff truly offers a huge variety of dining options, and every meal felt like part of the adventure!

## Final Thoughts

![](https://bloghalfpintmama.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/img_2759-1.jpg?w=768)

Traveling to Banff with kids in November is a magical experience filled with breathtaking scenery, festive charm, and family-friendly activities. I highly recommend visiting in November, as it offers a completely different experience from the popular summer months with their bright blue lakes. Instead, you'll find snow-covered peaks, twinkling Christmas decorations, and a serene winter wonderland. Dress warmly, plan for some downtime, and embrace the slower pace for a relaxed and unforgettable family adventure in the heart of the Canadian Rockies.
