*I'm going to go ahead and blame this all on sourdough.*

After having my second child, I decided to try my hand at baking sourdough. I’d watched video after video of people gently stretching their dough, talking about feeding their starter, and I thought, “I want that.” I wanted the slow, intentional rhythm of it. It is the kind of work that makes you pause, use your hands, and create something from scratch.

That first loaf was far from perfect but it lit a spark in me. From there, everything began to snowball. I very quickly realized I would never buy bread again. As dramatic as it sounds, I was hooked. If I could make bread from just flour, water, salt… what else could I make? What else could I learn to do for myself?

For me, homesteading isn’t just about growing food or raising animals. It’s about reclaiming simplicity and becoming more self sufficient. It’s about slowing down and finding joy in everyday tasks. Task like kneading dough, hanging laundry in the sunshine, or watching flowers bloom that I planted.

I want to raise my children in a world where they understand that food doesn’t just come from a store shelf. I want them to know the feeling of dirt under their fingernails, the satisfaction of making something by hand, and having the skills to do that.

Homesteading in the Suburbs

Here’s the thing, we don’t live on acres of land yet. We’re still right here in the suburbs, with neighbors on both sides and a modest backyard. And yes, an HOA that can get a little wild with its rules. But that doesn’t mean I can’t start learning the skills I’ll need when we finally get there.

For me, the easiest place to start has been in the kitchen. Home cooking has always been something I’ve loved, but lately I’ve been taking it a step further and truly cooking from scratch. Where I once reached for a box mix, I’m now realizing I can make it at home with fewer ingredients and far better flavor. We bake all our own bread and treats from scratch (definitely sourdough everything). My repertoire is slowly growing, from homemade granola to simmering bone broth.

The raised garden beds will have to wait for now, but I’ve started growing herbs on the patio. I want to learn to sew, can, and preserve. Really, it’s about trading in modern conveniences and finding the beauty in slow, intentional living.

I’ve realized that homesteading isn’t defined by a place, it’s a mindset. It’s about choosing to live more simply and purposefully, right where you are.

Choosing Progress Over Perfection

It’s easy to get discouraged scrolling through social media. Sometimes I catch myself feeling behind, like I can’t truly call myself a homesteader until we have that land. But the truth is, every journey starts somewhere.

Right now, I’m in the learning phase. The practice phase. And that’s a beautiful place to be. Because when the time comes and we finally break ground on our dream homestead, I’ll already have the skills, the rhythms, and the heart ready to go.

Until then, I’ll keep baking my sourdough, tending to my herbs, and learning everything I can.

What’s Next

This little suburban start is just the beginning. I’ve been dreaming up ways to share more of this journey. Not just here on the blog, but through video, too. I plan to start a YouTube channel soon to document the process of learning homesteading skills from scratch. I’m working on sharing all things sourdough as well as sewing, to gardening and beyond.

Expect more posts here on Half Pint Mama where I’ll share what I’m learning, what’s working (and what isn’t), and how you can start your own homestead journey. Even if you’re right in the middle of suburbia like me.

Because homesteading isn’t about perfection or acreage. It’s about having the simple joy of creating something real and lasting.
