## Instructions

Combine all dry ingredients into a bowl and then stir together. One great thing about this dough is there is no raw eggs so it is safe to eat. My toddler is pretty fast to tryout what he's mixing together.

Add milk at this time and stir. Continue to stir and add additional TBSP of milk one at a time to get the right consistency. For us this took 2 additional TBSP of milk. I think almond milk would be great, we just always have whole milk at home so that is what we used.

Form into a egg-like, oval shape and place on parchment paper lined baking sheet. I would say we did roughly about 1 TBSP size, but you can make these as small or big as you would like. Just remember they will get a little larger once dipped in chocolate. Place in the refrigerator for 1 hour. This hardens the dough a little and makes them easier to handle when dipping in the chocolate.

Melt down dark chocolate. Either on the stove or in the microwave at 30 second intervals (stirring in between). I had to added a little coconut oil but this is optional.

After the egg shaped dough has cooled in the refrigerator, use a fork dip them into the melted dark chocolate. Covering the entire egg with chocolate on all sides. Let excess chocolate drip off and set back on parchment paper lined baking sheet. Fully allowing excess chocolate to drip off prevents the truffles from having bottoms or look like a "hat". Once all balls are covered in chocolate return to parchment paper covered baking sheet and put in the fridge for about 2 hours.

Now they are ready to enjoy! Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator.

I wanted to recreate the classic Reese’s Peanut Butter Easter Eggs with a slightly healthier twist for my toddler, and these turned out even better than I hoped! They’re made with simple, wholesome ingredients and were so much fun to make together as a sweet little holiday kitchen activity. Soft, chocolatey, and just the right amount of indulgent—these are definitely going on our Easter tradition list!

### Baking with a Toddler

Baking with a toddler is equal parts joyful and messy, turning a simple recipe into a delightful adventure. Little hands eager to pour, stir, and sneak tastes make the kitchen come alive with laughter and curiosity. Measuring ingredients becomes a mini math lesson, it is practice with dexterity and a sensory activity like no other. While flour might end up on the floor as much as in the bowl, these spills and smudges create memories just as sweet as the treats themselves. I am always so amazed what little humans can do with practice and a little patience. Baking with a toddler may take a bit longer, but it’s filled with so many amazing moments.

We absolutely love this toddler tower. One of my favorite things is that we can wipe it down to clean it. It folds up pretty compact but we typically keep it at the counter. Porter loves helping so this is a necessity!
