Sourdough cookies are a fantastic way to enjoy a classic sweet treat while incorporating the benefits of natural fermentation. Using sourdough starter (either active or discard) in cookie dough enhances the flavor, adding a slight tang and depth that balances sweetness beautifully. The fermentation process also helps break down gluten and phytic acid, making the cookies easier to digest while potentially improving nutrient absorption. Plus, sourdough cookies often have a chewier texture and richer taste, making them a unique twist on traditional recipes.

Using fed sourdough starter in cookies can add a slight lift and tenderness, while discard contributes a subtle tangy flavor without extra rise, making it perfect for chewy, rich cookies. The natural fermentation process helps break down grains, making the cookies easier to digest while adding depth to the flavor.

Sourdough cookies can be made with either a long fermentation or a quick mix-and-bake method, depending on your preference and schedule.

- Quick Sourdough Cookies – If you’re short on time, you can mix the dough and bake right away (after refrigerating the dough for 30 min to 1 hour) for using fed sourdough starter or discard. This method still adds a mild sourdough flavor but doesn’t allow for much fermentation.

- Long Ferment Sourdough Cookies – For a deeper flavor and improved digestibility, you can let the dough ferment in the fridge for 12-48 hours before baking. This gives the sourdough culture time to break down gluten and phytic acid, making the cookies gentler on digestion and developing a more complex, tangy flavor.

Both methods result in delicious, chewy cookies, but if you want the full benefits of sourdough fermentation, the long-ferment option is worth the wait!

## Instructions

Using a light-colored pan (so you can see the color change), melt unsalted butter over medium heat. Watch for foaming. Stir occasionally to prevent burning. After a few minutes, small brown bits will form at the bottom of the pan, and the butter will turn golden brown. You’ll smell a rich, nutty aroma—this means it’s ready! Once browned, immediately transfer the butter to a heatproof bowl to prevent burning. Let the butter cool down.

In a bowl, whisk together flour, cornstarch, baking soda, and salt. Set to the side.

In a separate large mixing bowl, whisk together melted butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar until combined and slightly creamy. You can do this by hand, using a hand-held electric mixer or by using a stand mixer. Whisk for about 1 min, sugars should turn a slightly lighter color.

Mix in the egg yolk, and vanilla extract until smooth. Now, add your sourdough starter (discard or active). I've tried this recipe with both active starter and discard, they both work! Flavor wise,I prefer active starter and a long ferment. Plus you get all those benefits of the sourdough breaking the gluten down. I talk about this more in the beginning of this recipe. I start by whisking the sourdough starter into the sugar mixture with my danish whisk. Then using a silicone spatula to smooth it out.

Combine the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients slowly with a silicone spatula. Do this until dough forms. Mix until just combined-try not to over mix at this point.

Fold in the dark chocolate chips. Cover dough and refrigerate. You need at least 30 min to 1 hour. I prefer to do a long ferment for at least 12 hours (or up to 48 hours). The sourdough helps develop the flavor and chilling helps ferment the dough, enhancing taste and texture.

Preheat the oven to 350°F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper or silicone mat. Using a cookie scoop, take about 2 tbsp (I like mine slightly smaller and used a 1.5 tablespoon-sized) portions of the dough onto the prepared baking sheet about 2 in apart. Feel free to make these as small or large as you would like. If you are a chocolate lover you can add extra chocolate chips to the top of the dough.

Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until edges are golden but centers are still soft. This is going to be very dependent on how big of a cookie scoop you use. Mine is about 1.5 tbsp and 8-9 minutes is a sweet spot for us. I've made a larger version before with a 3 tbsp scoop and those took closer to 14 minutes.

Let them cool on the baking sheet for about 5 min and then transfer to a wire cooling rack. At this point you could also top with flaky sea salt if you would like. Now they are ready to enjoy!

The sourdough adds depth of flavor and a slight chewiness. I hope you love these cookies as much as I do. Store them in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days or in the fridge for up to a week.
