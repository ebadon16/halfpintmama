If your little one is anything like mine, there's a good chance Buzz Lightyear has made an appearance (or two) in your home lately. So when my toddler asked to be Buzz for Halloween, I took it as the perfect excuse to get crafty and make a simple, budget-friendly costume right at home. Just some cardboard, paint, and a little imagination!

## How to Make It

#### Step 1: Cut the Shapes

Start by cutting out the main pieces—a back plate, a pair of wings, and a pair of jet pack fuel pieces.

I had my toddler lay down on the cardboard for size reference. I made the wings about his arm span. For the back plate I sized it to fit comfortably on his back like a backpack. Don't worry about perfection; once it's painted, the charm is in the handmade look.

#### Step 2: Paint Everything

Using acrylic paint, cover your pieces with white as the base color.

I did this for every piece except the wings (only white at the top), both front and back. Once dry, add Buzz's signature green, purple, and red accents. I had my son's Buzz action figure as reference but you could pull up a photo for reference.

#### Step 3: Assemble the Wings

Attach [elastic ribbon](https://amzn.to/3L9haeU) to the wings so your child can easily slip their arms through.

I cut a small slit at each corner of the back plate and slipped the elastic through. I then triple knotted it and cut off any excess. Essentially making it look like a backpack.

#### Step 4: Glue It All Together

Once the paint is dry, glue on all your pieces.

Wings attach to the back plate first and the jet packs go over the wings. Let it dry completely before playtime begins.

## To Infinity and Beyond!

And that's it! A homemade Buzz Lightyear costume that's budget friendly and sparks a whole lot of joy. Underneath the wings we used this [inexpensive PJ](https://liketk.it/5t69o) set to tie it all together. This is the [mask](https://amzn.to/3JyUBjc) we used for his head as well. The mask is meant for adults and has the nose and mouth covered, but on my toddler his whole face was exposed so it really looked like Buzz. There's something so special about watching your child run around in something you made with your own hands.
