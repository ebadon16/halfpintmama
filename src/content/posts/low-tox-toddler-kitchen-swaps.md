As a mom, I'm always mindful of what my kids are exposed to, from the food they eat to the products we use daily. With so many hidden chemicals in everyday items, I've become more intentional about making safer choices for our home—especially in the kitchen, where so much of our family's daily life happens. One of my biggest goals has been reducing plastic use. By making small, mindful swaps—like choosing stainless steel over plastic, using glass storage instead of plastic containers—I'm creating a healthier, low-toxic space for my family. It's a journey, but every little step counts toward a safer, more sustainable home!

Switching to low-toxic alternatives doesn't have to happen overnight. It can feel overwhelming (and expensive) to replace everything at once, but the good news is that small, gradual changes make a big impact over time. Many eco-friendly and non-toxic swaps—like stainless steel water bottles, glass food storage, or wooden utensils—may have a higher upfront cost, but they tend to last much longer than their plastic counterparts, making them a worthwhile investment. Every step toward a safer, healthier home is a step in the right direction! Here are some simple, toddler-friendly kitchen swaps to help keep your home safer and healthier and reduce exposure to harmful chemicals!

## Planet Box Glacier Water Bottle

![](https://bloghalfpintmama.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/glacierwaterbottle-pansy01.png?w=1024)

[Glacier Water Bottle Link](https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-101235391-15334821?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.planetbox.com%2Fproducts%2Fglacier-water-bottle%3Fvariant%3D41486513242251%26currency%3DUSD%26utm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_medium%3Dcpc%26utm_campaign%3Dgoogle%252Bshopping&cjsku=shopify_US_7152242262155_41486513242251)

**Pros:** Constructed from high-quality stainless steel, which is free from BPA, phthalates, and other harmful chemicals found in plastic bottles. No plastic, even the straw is made of stainless steel. Silicone is the only other material used on this water bottle. Wide mouth opening makes it easy to clean. Leak proof when the straw is closed. Double-walled, vacuum-insulated design keeps water cold for hours.

**Cons:** Higher upfront cost- However, the durability makes it a long-term investment. When the straw is in the open position and turned upside down the water will come out. I only mention this because my kids like to dump things so I have to make sure the straw is closed when not in use.

**Pros:** The plate is designed with a curved edge, which helps kids scoop up food more easily. This encourages them to eat independently, promoting self-feeding skills. The removable silicone divider helps the plate grow with kids as they get older. It's made of plants rather than traditional plastics. It uses PLA which is made of cornstarch and sugar cane. Durable and built to withstand drops, bangs, and general toddler roughness. It is also dishwasher save.

**Cons:** Though heavier than traditional plastic plates, my baby can flip this plate and dump the food out of it.

## Elk and Friends Stainless Steel Cups

![](https://bloghalfpintmama.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/71aqwuxmybl._ac_sl1500_.jpg?w=972)

[Elk and Friends Stainless Steel Cups Link](https://amzn.to/4iyWCIe)

**Pros:** Durable and easy to clean, these are a favorite to drink milk out of. Wide mouth makes cleaning and breeze, plus they are dishwasher safe. Straw is made of silicone and has a stopper on the bottom to prevent toddlers from completely pulling it out of the cup. Non-Straw top is great to convert this cup into a snack container.

**Cons:** The lid is made of plastic. They are not spill proof, when turned upside down they do leak. There is also no way to close off the straw so not good for on-the-go use.

I've been prioritizing using low-toxic kitchenware for my toddler and baby and will be sharing more as we try to be more mindful.  Trying to opt for non-toxic, BPA-free, and phthalate-free products reduces the risk of exposure to harmful substances. I have found that low-toxic kitchenware is also durable, eco-friendly, and often easy to clean, making it a practical choice.
