These are made in a muffin tin and such a fun recipe to use up sourdough discard. Not only do you get to satisfy pizza cravings but this is definitely kid-approved. This is a lunch favorite in our house

These bite-sized pizzas are crispy and endlessly customizable. They're perfect for little hands and lunches. My husband says they are a better version of the "bagel bites" we had growing up.

## Step-By-Step

Preheat oven to 425°F** **and lightly grease a muffin tin with olive oil. This is the [muffin tin](https://amzn.to/4kazgJA) we use and love. It is non-toxic and non-stick and I've never had any issues with my mini pizzas getting stuck.

In a bowl, mix together the sourdough discard, sugar, salt, and Italian seasoning until combined. This is not the easiest to mix but I feel like this gives the dough a great flavor. Technically these are optional and you could do just straight discard. I have also made these with fed sourdough and I really don't change the recipe, the dough will just rise slightly more. I never tend to have a ton of discard, so that is an option.

Spoon about 1/2 tablespoons of the batter into each muffin cup. The key is to not put too much or else they will be chewier. Personally my family prefers them crispy. Also want to make sure that dough is cooking all the way through. Using your finger or a spoon, spread out the dough until it covers the entire bottom of the muffin cup.

Bake at 450°F** **for 8-10 minutes. You want the dough to be mostly baked before adding your toppings. Keep a close eye on them because with the high heat they can burn easily.

Remove muffin tin with baked dough from oven and add toppings. At this time decrease the oven to 425°F. Drop a small spoonful of pizza/marinara sauce on top of each cup, and spread out evenly. Then sprinkle with cheese and add your favorite toppings—think diced bell peppers, mushrooms, pepperoni, or olives. My kids favorite is just cheese and pepperoni. I get the mini pepperonis and cut them in half both ways, making four little triangles out of the one pepperoni.

Bake for an additional 5 minutes at 425°F. They should be a little golden around the edges.

Cool slightly before removing from the pan. Serve warm, or let them cool completely and store in the fridge for up to 3 days. These can also be freezer-friendly by freezing leftovers in a single layer, then transfer to a bag. Reheat in a toaster oven or air fryer.
