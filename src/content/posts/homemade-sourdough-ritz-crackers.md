*These copycat Ritz crackers have the added benefit of sourdough* and *are buttery, crisp, and made with real ingredients!*

Since I started cooking more from scratch, I realized I could make my own version at home with simple pantry ingredients and my trusty sourdough starter.

These sourdough Ritz style crackers are everything you love about the store-bought version but made with real ingredients and no seed oils. They're dangerously easy to snack on and the perfect way to use up a little sourdough starter.

You can eat them plain or dip them in hummus. My personal favorite is to sandwich them between peanut butter for a homemade twist on a childhood classic.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

#### Step 1: Combine the dry ingredients

![](https://bloghalfpintmama.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/img_9775.jpg?w=768)

In a [food processor](https://amzn.to/4ouDEpr) (or large bowl) combine:

1½ cups all-purpose flour, 2 teaspoons baking powder, 1 tablespoon organic cane sugar, ½ teaspoon salt

Pulse or whisk to evenly distribute everything.

*the cane sugar can be evenly replaced with granulated sugar

#### Step 2: Cut in the butter

Add 6 tablespoons cold, cubed unsalted butter to the mixture. I will do this in two batches, so 3 tablespoons at a time.

Pulse several times (or cut in with a pastry cutter if using a bowl only) until the mixture looks sandy, you should have small pea-sized bits of butter.

That little butter texture is what gives you those classic, flaky Ritz layers.

#### Step 3: Add the wet ingredients

Pour in: ½ cup sourdough starter (active or discard will work), 2 tablespoons olive oil and ⅓ cup water*.

Pulse or mix until the dough just comes together. It should be soft but not sticky. If it's too dry, add another teaspoon or two of water.

*I used about 1/3 cup of cold water but it may take up to 1/2 cup. Add the water last and only do a little at a time.

#### Step 4: Chill the dough

Kneed lightly on a floured surface just until the dough comes together. Divide the dough into three portions, flatten them into discs, wrap in plastic or beeswax wrap, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. To get the added benefit of the sourdough I keep mine in the fridge for about 12-24 hours for a longer fermentation.

Refrigerating makes the dough easier to roll out and helps those butter layers stay flaky.

#### Step 5: Roll and cut

Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C).

Working with one portion at a time, [roll out](https://amzn.to/4i4x1aX) the dough very thin, about 1/4 inch or less. I have found I get the best success when I do this between two sheets of parchment paper. Even with a floured surface this dough seems to stick. The thinner you roll, the crisper the crackers! I try to work quick because as the dough warms up it becomes harder to work with. I have definitely thrown my down back in the fridge for a little to make my life easier.

Use a small [round cutter](https://amzn.to/3Xp3Buy) (or the rim of a shot glass would work) to cut out crackers. Use a fork to poke holes in the center for that classic Ritz look. To avoid the fork sticking to the dough I will roll the fork down.

#### Step 6: Bake

Transfer the parchment sheet with the cut crackers onto a baking sheet. I also love using this [baking sheet](https://amzn.to/442tWSQ) because it's already nonstick.

![](https://bloghalfpintmama.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image.jpg?w=1024)

Bake at 400°F for 10–12 minutes, until lightly golden around the edges.

Keep a close eye near the end. They go from golden to too done quickly!

#### Step 7: Toss in butter and salt

![](https://bloghalfpintmama.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/img_9796.jpg?w=768)

While still hot, toss the crackers in a bowl with a little melted butter and a sprinkle of salt. This step gives them that irresistible, buttery Ritz flavor.

#### Step 8: Cool and enjoy

![](https://bloghalfpintmama.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/img_9805-1.jpg?w=768)

Let the crackers cool completely before storing.

Once cooled, store in an airtight container for up to a week. They definitely don't last that long in my house!
