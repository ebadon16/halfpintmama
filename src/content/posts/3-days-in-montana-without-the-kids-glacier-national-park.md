Every once in a while, life gives you the chance to step out of the routines of parenting. For us, that chance came with a wedding in Montana. We packed light (like really light-flew with the tent and a carry on), left the diaper bag at home, and gave ourselves three days of mountains, hiking boots, and late-night conversations. But, of course, even without the kids in tow, we found ourselves still pulling up their photos on our phones and saying things like, *“Oh, they would love this burger”* or *“Can’t wait to bring them on this trail someday.”* That’s the parent brain for you.

## Day 1: Travel & Glacier National Park 

After landing in the charming Kalispell airport (seriously, it looks more like a cozy lodge than an airport), we wandered into town to stretch our legs and explore Main Street. My husband and I definitely agree it's a night and day difference when flying without the kids. We grabbed lunch at Norm’s Soda Fountain, where I tried the bison burger. Honestly? It was just okay—I probably wouldn’t recommend it. (Spoiler: we found a much better burger in Whitefish on Day 3.) Before heading out, we stopped by Bonelli’s for sandwiches to pack in our backpacks for a later hike.

That evening we checked into our HipCamp site ([Campsite we stayed at-highly recommend ](https://www.hipcamp.com/en-US/land/montana-robinson-s-roost-zwjhv79q/sites/407052?accommodations=tents&adults=1&children=0&srid=09fcc387-3d97-435b-9556-23af23af0056&siteId=407052)), quickly set up camp, and headed straight into Glacier National Park. At the time of our trip, the west entrance required timed entry passes during the day, but we learned that after 3 p.m. you could enter without one—perfect for our sunset hike. Driving the iconic *Going to the Sun Road* felt surreal. Every turn opened up to jaw-dropping views, the kind that make you quiet for a minute just to take it in.

Parking was tricky, but we eventually found a spot near Lake McDonald and started out on the Trail of the Cedars. The boardwalk wound through towering trees and across a bridge with a rushing waterfall, before connecting to the trail for Avalanche Lake. The hike itself was moderate- not too steep, but just enough to feel like we’d earned the view at the end. And what a view it was. The lake sat surrounded by dramatic cliffs, with streaks of old avalanche trails spilling down into the turquoise water.

We found a log to perch on, cracked open a local beer, and unwrapped our sandwiches from Bonelli’s. Maybe it was the mountain air or the long day of travel, but that simple meal tasted incredible. We laughed, we exhaled, and we couldn’t help but imagine our kids running straight into that icy water without hesitation. In that moment, it felt like we were not only soaking in Glacier for ourselves, but also dreaming about the day we’d share it with them.

## Day 2: Sunrise on the Highline Trail

The next morning came *early*—coffee in hand, headlamps on—as we drove into the park for a sunrise hike on the legendary Highline Trail. Because of the timed-entry system, we learned that if you enter before 7 a.m., you don’t need a pass. That little loophole is gold, especially since this is one of Glacier’s most popular hikes (and for good reason).

We parked at the Logan Pass Visitor Center around 6 a.m., and the lot was already filling fast—definitely plan ahead since the drive from the west entrance takes about 30–45 minutes. From the very first steps, the trail was jaw-dropping. Every turn seemed more stunning than the last, with endless views of jagged peaks, wildflower meadows, and narrow cliffside paths that made the early alarm totally worth it.

Our original plan was to hike to Haystack Pass and turn around, making it a manageable 7.2 mile out and back. But Haystack isn’t very clearly marked, and before we knew it, we had gone *way* past it. Instead of turning around, we decided to just keep going—pushing ourselves all the way through the entire trail and adding the spur up to the Glacier Overlook. By the end of the day, we clocked 13.4 miles.

That spur to the Glacier Overlook is only 0.8 miles up, but don’t let that number fool you—it’s a steep climb that had us questioning our life choices with every step. Still, the views at the top were pretty unreal. The final four miles downhill were tough on the knees, and looking back, I think I’d recommend turning around at the Overlook instead of continuing on to the shuttle stop. It would still be a 14–15 mile day, but the views are better and you don’t have to deal with waiting for a shuttle back to your car. This shuttle stop can get really backed up. We caught it just in time but when driving back it looked as if people would be waiting there for hours.

By the time we finished, we were completely spent but also buzzing with that “we really did it” feeling. That night, we traded hiking boots for something a little nicer and joined friends for the wedding’s welcome dinner. We may have been walking a little stiffly, but it felt like the perfect blend of adventure and celebration.

If we hadn’t been so wiped, I would have loved to squeeze in the Hidden Lake Overlook hike right from the same Logan Pass parking lot. At just 2.8 miles round trip, it’s much shorter and still has incredible views. But that one will have to wait until next time.

## Day 3: Whitefish & the Wedding

On our last day, we finally slowed down and soaked in a little more of Montana at an easier pace. We strolled through downtown Whitefish, popping into boutiques and coffee shops, and picking up a few treats to bring back home. Between Kalispell and Whitefish, I definitely preferred Whitefish’s Main Street. It just had more of a cozy, mountain-town charm. For lunch, we grabbed burgers at Mudman Burger, and wow… highly recommend. The homemade buns alone made it worth it (though I did skip the chili on the burger and keep it on the side).

Later that afternoon, we put on our wedding attire and headed to celebrate the happy couple. After the ceremony, we ended the evening gathered around a fire, swapping stories, laughing, and soaking in the last bits of Montana magic. It was the perfect way to close out the trip.

The next morning came way too early with a hectic dash through the airport (nearly missing our flight...oops!). But once we were on the plane, we exhaled, grateful to be heading home safely to our babies.

## Final Thoughts

This trip was short—just three days—but Montana made such an impression on us. August felt like the perfect time to visit Glacier National Park: the weather was incredible, all the trails were open, and the cool nights made for ideal camping. We hiked hard, we celebrated love, and we breathed in some of the most breathtaking scenery we’ve ever seen.

One day, we can’t wait to bring our kids back to show them Avalanche Lake, the Highline Trail, and that picture-perfect little Main Street in Whitefish. But for now, it was something really special to just experience it together.
