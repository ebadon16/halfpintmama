## Step-by-Step Instructions

#### Step 1: Prepare your ingredients and pan

Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Lightly grease a standard 9x5" loaf pan with coconut oil or line it with parchment paper for easy removal.

#### Step 2: Mash the bananas

In a large mixing bowl, mash 2 ripe bananas. The riper the better—they're the main source of sweetness and flavor.

#### Step 3: Add the wet ingredients

To the mashed bananas, add:
- 1/2 cup sourdough discard (unfed)
- 1 egg
- 1/3 cup melted coconut oil
- 3/4 cup maple syrup
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract

Stir until everything is smooth and well combined. The mixture should look creamy and slightly glossy.

#### Step 4: Mix the dry ingredients separately

In a medium bowl, whisk together:
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- Pinch of salt
- 1 teaspoon cinnamon

This step ensures even distribution of the leavening agent.

#### Step 5: Combine wet and dry ingredients

Gently add the dry ingredients into the wet. Stir with a spatula or wooden spoon until just combined. Be careful not to overmix—you want the batter to stay tender.

#### Step 6: Pour and smooth

Transfer the batter to your prepared loaf pan and smooth the top with a spatula.

#### Step 7: Bake

Place in the preheated oven and bake for **50 minutes**, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean or with just a few crumbs. If the top is browning too quickly, tent it with foil in the last 10 minutes.

#### Step 8: Cool and enjoy

Let the banana bread cool in the pan for 10–15 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack. Slice once cooled—or sneak a warm slice if you just can't wait. I love adding a little butter to my slice while it's still hot!
