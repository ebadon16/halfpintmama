On hot afternoons, there’s nothing my toddler loves more than a popsicle—and I love knowing exactly what’s in it. These healthy mango coconut popsicles are a quick and nourishing treat made with just four wholesome ingredients. They’re creamy, naturally sweetened, and full of real fruit flavor—without any added dyes or refined sugar. Plus, they’re fun for little hands to help with!

This recipe has quickly become a favorite in our house. My toddler loves helping me dump the ingredients into the food processor (and stealing mango chunks along the way), and the end result feels like a treat we can both feel good about.

### **Step-by-Step: How to Make Healthy Toddler Popsicles**

**Step 1: Choose ripe, juicy mangoes**
You’ll need about 2 cups of fresh mango chunks. Ataulfo or honey mangoes are especially sweet and creamy, but any ripe mango will do. If fresh mango isn’t available, you can use frozen—just thaw them slightly before blending.

**Step 2: Blend with coconut milk**
Add the mango chunks to a blender or food processor along with 1 cup of full-fat coconut milk. This gives the popsicles their creamy texture and healthy fats—perfect for growing little ones. Make sure to give the can a good shake before opening so the milk is well mixed.

**Step 3: Add natural sweetness and flavor**
Next, add 1 tablespoon of honey and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract. Taste the mixture—if your mangoes are very ripe, you may even want to reduce the honey slightly. These don't make a very sweet mixture so you may want to increase to 2 tbsp of honey depending on the taste you are going for.

> 
**Note:** Skip the honey if your child is under 1 year old. You can substitute mashed banana or a couple of soaked dates instead, even maple syrup is a great option. But your mangoes may be sweet enough on their own!

**Step 4: Blend until smooth**
Blend everything together until the mixture is completely smooth and creamy. You shouldn’t see any chunks—this helps with texture, especially for toddlers still learning to navigate icy treats.

**Step 5: Pour into molds**
Carefully pour the mixture into popsicle molds. If you don’t have molds, small paper cups with popsicle sticks work too. Leave a little room at the top for expansion as they freeze. We love using these little [zip lock baggies](https://amzn.to/3TGa9TZ) made for popsicles.

**Step 6: Freeze and enjoy**
Freeze for at about 6 hours, or overnight if you can. Once fully frozen, run the molds under warm water for a few seconds to help release the popsicles. If using the baggies, no need to run under water. 

Now you’ve got a batch of refreshing, fruit-filled popsicles perfect for snack time, post-nap treats, or backyard cool-downs!
