Lately, I’ve been looking for easy and cost-effective ways to make snacks for my kids at home. With our grocery bill soaring, I’m trying to get creative to cut costs while ensuring we have healthy options. I also love knowing exactly what goes into the food we snack on. It’s astonishing how many ingredients are listed on the back of a box for kids’ snacks—store-bought fruit roll-ups, for example, have around 18 ingredients! I’ve discovered I can make them at home with just three simple ingredients, and my toddler is now obsessed with these homemade apple and mango fruit roll-ups! My first flavor combo to try was apple and blueberry, and both have been a hit!

## Instructions

![](https://bloghalfpintmama.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/img_4605-1.jpg?w=1024)

Preheat your oven to 170°F and line a baking sheet with a silicone mat. Parchment paper would also work well. In a saucepan over medium heat you are going to sauté and cook down the fruit. Combine the apples (I use about 2 medium sized apples), mangos, and lemon juice. Cook for roughly 10 minutes and stir occasionally. You want to wait until the fruit softens a little and releases juices.

Let the mixture cool slightly, then transfer it to a blender or food processor. I just used our blender. Blend until smooth. At this point you can taste the mixture and see if it has the amount of sweetness you like. You can add honey (only for toddler over 1 year old) or maple syrup. Maybe 1–2 tbsp and re-blend. This time I felt like the mixture could use a little bit of sweetness, I added 2 tbsp of honey.

Pour and spread the fruit puree onto the silicone or parchment paper lines baking sheet. Try to spread it evenly out.

Place the baking sheet in the oven at 170°F and bake for 4–6 hours or until the fruit layer is not sticky to the touch. It should easily peel away from the lines baking sheet.

Let it cool completely, then cut it into strips using kitchen scissors or a knife. You can then roll the strips in parchment paper for easy storage.

Now they are ready to enjoy! I store them in an airtight container at room temperature for up to a week.
