Preheat your oven to 350°F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper or silicone baking sheet. In a food processor, blend the cheese, flour, garlic powder, and salt. Add the cold butter cubes and pulse until the mixture looks crumbly.  Slowly add 2-3 tbsp of cold water, one at a time, and blend until a dough forms. If it’s too dry, add another tbsp of water. I used 3 tbsp of water this time.

On a floured surface mix dough together with your hands. Kneed until a ball of dough forms.

On a floured surface, using a rolling pin- roll out the dough to about ⅛-inch thickness. If you are having a hard time working with the dough you can roll it out between two pieces of parchment paper.

Use a knife, pizza cutter or pastry cutter to cut small squares (about 1-inch) and poke a hole in the center of each with a toothpick for that classic Cheez-It look! Transfer to the baking sheet and bake for 12-15 minutes, or until golden and crisp.

 Let them cool completely and enjoy! These  will crisp up more as they cool. You can add additional salt to the top as needed for taste, depending on your personal preference.

Store in an airtight container for up to a week at room temperature.
