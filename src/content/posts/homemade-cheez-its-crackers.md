## Instructions

#### Step 1: Blend ingredients

Preheat your oven to 350°F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper or silicone baking sheet. In a food processor, blend the cheese, flour, garlic powder, and salt. Add the cold butter cubes and pulse until the mixture looks crumbly.  Slowly add 2-3 tbsp of cold water, one at a time, and blend until a dough forms. If it's too dry, add another tbsp of water. I used 3 tbsp of water this time.

#### Step 2: Knead the dough

On a floured surface mix dough together with your hands. Kneed until a ball of dough forms.

#### Step 3: Roll out the dough

On a floured surface, using a rolling pin- roll out the dough to about 1/8-inch thickness. If you are having a hard time working with the dough you can roll it out between two pieces of parchment paper.

#### Step 4: Cut and bake

Use a knife, pizza cutter or pastry cutter to cut small squares (about 1-inch) and poke a hole in the center of each with a toothpick for that classic Cheez-It look! Transfer to the baking sheet and bake for 12-15 minutes, or until golden and crisp.

#### Step 5: Cool and enjoy

Let them cool completely and enjoy! These  will crisp up more as they cool. You can add additional salt to the top as needed for taste, depending on your personal preference.
